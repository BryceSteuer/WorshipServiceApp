# Worship Service Application
This is an app I am building from some boilerplate grocery list code. the basic function is to be able to list hymn names and numbers that were sung during the week's worship service. These can then be on record and queried later when needed. Also, hymns should have tags (i.e, Justice of God, Christ the Bridegroom, etc)
